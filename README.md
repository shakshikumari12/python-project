# PYTHON PROJECT :AMAZON REVIEW USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
## Overview
The Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis project is designed to analyze Amazon customer reviews to gauge sentiment and provide valuable insights for optimizing business strategies. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, this project aims to classify and understand the underlying sentiments expressed in reviews. By interpreting these sentiments, businesses can better understand customer feedback and improve their products and services accordingly.

## Tech Stack
This project is built using a comprehensive tech stack tailored for NLP and sentiment analysis:

Python: The primary programming language used for developing the project.

#### ROBERTA: A transformer model used for fine-tuned sentiment analysis.

#### VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): A lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

#### NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing.

#### PyTorch: An open-source machine learning library used for implementing deep learning models.

#### Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib, used for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
Features

#### The Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis project comes equipped with a range of features to facilitate comprehensive sentiment analysis:

#### Sentiment Classification: Utilizes transformer models like ROBERTA for accurate sentiment classification of Amazon reviews.

#### Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis: Employs VADER for rule-based sentiment analysis, enhancing the interpretability of results.

#### Data Visualization: Uses Seaborn to create insightful visualizations that depict sentiment trends and patterns in the review data.

#### Preprocessing: Implements NLTK for preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization to prepare the text data for analysis.

#### Deep Learning: Leverages PyTorch for building and training deep learning models to improve sentiment prediction accuracy.

## Usage
This project is designed to analyze Amazon reviews and classify them into different sentiment categories. The primary usage involves preprocessing the review data, applying sentiment analysis models, and visualizing the results.
